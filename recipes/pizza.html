        <li>1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>For the tomato sauce</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>100ml passata</li>
        <li>handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>For the topping </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>125g ball mozzarella, sliced</li>
        <li>handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
        <li>handful of cherry tomatoes, halved</li>

    <h2>To finish</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>handful of basil leaves (optional) </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
      <li><h2>STEP 1</h2> <p>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. 
        Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. 
        Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like,
        but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</p></li>
      <li><h2>STEP 2</h2> <p>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</p></li>
      <li><h2>STEP 3</h2> <p>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin.
        The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</p></li>
      <li><h2>STEP 4</h2> <p>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. 
        Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</p></li>
